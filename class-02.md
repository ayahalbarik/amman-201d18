# Key Differences between JSP & HTML :
>HTML is a client side scripting language while JSP is a server side programming technology.
HTML is fast as it runs on client (browser) while JSP is slower to load as it runs on server (Apache tomcat, glassfish)
HTML is simple to code, JSP needs some knowledge of Java programming to use it to full extent.

HTML needs cascading style sheets (CSS) and javaScript (JS) to make it look interactive as it is Static in nature while JSP can interact without the help of CSS & JS even then we can use CSS & JS with JSP pages to make them more elegant and user friendly.
JSP have access to the entire family of Java APIs, including the JDBC API to access enterprise databases while HTML  very limited in this case.
In JSP, we can use a lot of tags such as action tags, jstl, custom tags etc. that reduces the code. Moreover, we can use EL, implicit objects etc. All this functionality is missing in HTML.
A JSP page consists of HTML tags and JSP tags while HTML can only have html tags.

## A JSP page can generate & contain dynamic information while regular HTML cannot.
JSP tags can be used for a variety of purposes, such as retrieving information from a database or registering user preferences, accessing JavaBeans components, passing control between pages and sharing information between requests, pages etc… while HTML needs a server side component to perform all these tasks.
JSP is an integral part of Java EE, a complete platform for enterprise class applications. This means that JSP can play a part in the simplest applications to the most complex and demanding while HTML doesn't even come close to this.

### What is the Difference Between JSP and HTML
The main difference between JSP and HTML is that JSP is a technology to create dynamic web applications while HTML is a standard markup language to create the structure of web pages.
There are millions of web pages available on the World Wide Web (WWW). The standard language for developing web pages is HTML. It is the base language for other web programming languages such as CSS and JavaScript. On the other hand, JSP helps to create dynamic web applications. A JSP file consists of HTML tags and JSP tags.

Difference Between JSP and HTML- Comparison Summary
What is JSP
JSP stands for Java Server Pages. These files have the extension .jsp. The main advantage of JSP is that the programmer can insert Java code inside HTML. There are JSP tags to insert Java code. The programmer can write the <% tag to start the Java code and write %> tag at the end of the Java code. Moreover, there are different JSP tags to accomplish various tasks. There are tags to share data between requests and pages, pass control between pages and to get data from databases, etc.
Difference Between JSP and HTML
JSP is built on top of a Java-based technology called Java Servlet. Usually, JSP works with Servlets to handle complex business logic in the Enterprise applications. JSP has access to many Java APIs such as JDBC, JNDI, and EJB. Overall, JSP helps to create dynamic web pages. It helps to accomplish tasks such as collecting user data from web pages and represent data from databases, etc.
What is HTML
HTML is a markup language that helps to build the structure of the web page. As it is a markup language, it consists of many tags. There are tags to display text, tables, ordered lists, unordered lists, etc. An HTML page consists of two main sections: head and body section. The metadata (data that describes the page) is inside the head section while the body section includes all the tags that are necessary to represent the visible content of the web page.
Main Difference - JSP vs HTML
There are various HTML versions. The latest version is HTML 5. It has more advanced features such as Geo-location, native audio, and video support, Canvas, web socket etc. Usually, HTML is an easy language to learn and use. A programmer can create an HTML file using a simple text editor and execute it using a web browser.
Relationship Between JSP and HTML
JSP allows inserting Java code inside an HTML file.
Difference Between JSP and HTML
Definition
JSP is a technology that helps software developers to create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML. HTML is a standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. Thus, this is the main difference between JSP and HTML.
Long Form
JSP stands for Java Server Pages while HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
Usage
Furthermore, another difference between JSP and HTML is that JSP helps to develop dynamic web applications whereas HTML helps to create the structure of web pages.
Conclusion
The main difference between JSP and HTML is that JSP is a technology to create dynamic web applications while HTML is a standard markup language to create the structure of web pages. In brief, JSP file is an HTML file with Java code.
